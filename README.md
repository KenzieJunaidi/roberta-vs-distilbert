# roberta-vs-distilbert
Comparative study of RoBERTa and DistilBERT for hate speech detection using Reddit data.

This repository contains code and experiments from our research project titled **"Hate Speech Detection: A Comparison Between RoBERTa and DistilBERT."**  
The project compares two transformer-based models in classifying Reddit posts into **hate**, **neutral**, and **counter-hate** categories.

> ðŸ“Œ Note: These files were originally developed and run in **Google Colab**, and later exported to this repository for sharing and reference.
